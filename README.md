Mnemosyne is a library built on top of TensorFlow 2 designed to provide simple, abstractions for deep learning and machine learning utility. It is built to be flexible and designed to minimize the iteration time when running experiments
and testing ideas. It's meant to be tweaked, with the code constantly evolving with additional modules/models added to aid the users.
