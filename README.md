# Mnemosyne
Mnemosyne is a library built on top of TensorFlow 2 designed to provide simple, abstractions for deep learning and machine learning utility. It is built to be flexible and designed to minimize the iteration time when running experiments
and testing ideas. It's meant to be tweaked, with the code constantly evolving with additional modules/models added to aid the users. 

MNEMOSYNE was the Titan goddess of memory and remembrance and the inventress of language and words. The project shares its name with the goddess due to their resemblance retain information and memory within themselves.
